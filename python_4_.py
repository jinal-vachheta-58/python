#4) Write a python program to read two numbers and display the greatest number.

a = int(input("Enter num for a : "))
b = int(input("Enter num for b : "))

if(a > b):
    print(a," : a is greater")
else:
    print(b," : b is greater")

#OUTPUT:
 #   Enter num for a : 56
  #  Enter num for b : 89
   # 89  : b is greater
